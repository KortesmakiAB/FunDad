---------------------------------------------------

HTTPS in development:
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() requires HTTPS

Here is my hacky way around this...

# $ pip install pyopenssl
# $ flask run --cert=adhoc

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(ssl_context='adhoc')

What would be a better way?

If not a better way, how can I config my browser so I don't keep getting a "Your connection is not private" message, which forces me to click 2 times to proceed?

Here is what Flask docs say...
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/master/security/#security-headers

SSL: HTTPS - different security model, chain of trust model. A cert authority that issues certs to responsible users. Need to 
EFF - ele frontier 
Let's Incrypt proj  - Free SSL Cert - use this for something other than Heroku.
https://letsencrypt.org/ - would need my own domain name - Cannot use this for localhost.
Chrome doesn't like this. You can work around it, but it's too much work.

---------------------------------------------------

WHat do I do about the differences in my code locally vs heroku?
    Environment variables. Just like Flask Environment varibles. 
WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THE API RESTRICTIONS?????????
Don't worry about it until real production.

Can I configure MINGW64 so that when I open a new window, it opens in my previous directory?
If I have 1 console window open, when I open a second console window, it will open in the same directory as window 1.

if time:

app.js
g.user = User.query.get(session[CURR_USER_KEY])
CURR_USER_KEY = 'curr_user'
Sooo.... g.user = User.query.get('curr_user')
curr_user is not an id number. Why is this working?

app.js
function addDestinationMarkers()
Why does the depricated function 'addListener' work when the supported function addEventListener() does not work? (My browser is up to date)
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: marker.addEventListener is not a function
