Here is a link to my evil plan:

---------------------------------------------------

HTTPS in development:
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() requires HTTPS

Here is my hacky way around this...

# $ pip install pyopenssl
# $ flask run --cert=adhoc

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(ssl_context='adhoc')

What would be a better way?

If not a better way, how can I config my browser so I don't keep getting a "Your connection is not private" message, which forces me to click 2 times to proceed?

Here is what Flask docs say...

WHat do I do about the differences in my code locally vs heroku?
WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THE API RESTRICTIONS?????????

Can I configure MINGW64 so that when I open a new window, it opens in my previous directory?
If I have 1 console window open, when I open a second console window, it will open in the same directory as window 1.

if time:

app.js
g.user = User.query.get(session[CURR_USER_KEY])
CURR_USER_KEY = 'curr_user'
Sooo.... g.user = User.query.get('curr_user')
curr_user is not an id number. Why is this working?

app.js
function addDestinationMarkers()
Why does the depricated function 'addListener' work when the supported function addEventListener() does not work? (My browser is up to date)
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: marker.addEventListener is not a function
