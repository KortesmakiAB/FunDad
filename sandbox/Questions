Here is a link to my evil plan:

---------------------------------------------------

Question 1
I'd like to have an interactive map with markers in FUN DAD. The Map API interactivity requires JavaScript.
As I am reading the Google API docs, it seems as though I have to include my API KEY in the <script> tag.Â  Even though I have placed an IP restriction on my API KEY, it doesn't seem very safe to put my API KEY right in the HTML.
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map#step_2_add_a_map_with_a_marker

Is there a better way to protect the api key? Perhaps would there be a way to put it in a .js file? But even then, it's still visible in the browser console. Or is it enough just to have IP restriction (Google Cloud Console)?

---------------------------------------------------

Question 2

Add drive times to /destinations page 

Is this the work flow I'll need?
1- Get current location, using  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()
    1a- DONE WITH JAVASCRIPT 
        1a1- WHEN? When page loads? Another event handler?
2- Call internal Flask API ROUTE (AJAX)
    2a- call Google Maps to get drive times
        destinations_times  = .distance_matrix()
        Note: mayebe return a list of tuples  (place_id, duration_in_traffic, name) or list of dicts
        Note: Can I send a list? Or do I need to make individual calls?
        Note: Error handling in case geolocation is not supported
    2b- return JSON
3- Update DOM
