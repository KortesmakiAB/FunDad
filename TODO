REMOVE error messages that get appended from app.js?
	Or do they dissapear on refresh? I don't think so.
	Is there a better way to handle these error messages?

Give user option to get drive time in case they tap the deny location button or geolocation doesn't work the first time.

Error handling:
	What if a user checks in at a new location, but the place_id already exists?
